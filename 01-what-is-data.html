<p>Like many other inventions, the origins of the telephone are murky at best. As a schoolchild I learned that Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone and, in a decidedly Archimedes moment, cried out to his assistant the now-famous line. Of course, I would later <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invention_of_the_telephone">learn</a> that inventions are seldom the work of a few. We — as inventors, as scientists, as researchers, as humans — stand on the shoulders of giants.</p>
<p>Or maybe they’re turtles.</p>
<p>Whatever we might like to believe about how the telephone came about, it has inarguably become a ubiqitous part of our lives. As of <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/fact-sheets/mobile-technology-fact-sheet/">January 2014</a>, 90% of American adults own a cell phone, resulting in about <a href="http://www.texasinsider.org/3-billion-phone-calls-made-in-us-every-day/">3 billion</a> phone calls every day. That’s over 30000 phone calls every <em>second</em>. Imagine all those calls, all those digital signals, <a href="http://www.telcomhistory.org/vm/scienceLongDistance.shtml">flying around</a> us every second of every day. And I’m not even bothering to include all the other ways that we communicate.</p>
<p>We are literally (yes, <a href="http://theoatmeal.com/comics/literally"><em>literally</em></a>) immersed in data. Drowning in it. Data is all around us in a dizzying array of forms, constant, inescapable. Strange, then, that we think so little about it.</p>
