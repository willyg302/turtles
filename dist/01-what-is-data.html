<p>“Mr. Watson — Come here — I want to see you.”</p>
<footer>Alexander Graham Bell</footer>

</blockquote>
<p>One fine Boston day in the year of 1876, a man by the name of Alexander Graham Bell made what is widely believed to be the first telephone call: he shouted to his assistant, who was standing in the next room, the now-famous line.</p>
<p>For the moment, let us disregard the possibility that Mr. Watson simply overheard what his boss had said (after all, Bell was shouting, and just how thick did 19th-century Bostonian scientists make their walls anyway?). Let us put aside the fact that Watson <a href="http://www.wired.com/2011/03/0310bell-invents-telephone-mr-watson-come-here/">reported</a> hearing something not quite the same. Let us forget all the controversy over whether Bell really did invent the telephone; inventions are seldom the work of a few, and one who patents is usually one who, having climbed on the shoulders of giants, reaches out meagerly and dares to touch the sky.</p>

<p><small>Alexander Graham Bell’s lab notebook, March 10, 1876.</small></p>
<p>March 10, 1876, was a special day because it marked the first time that humans captured sound and <span style="color: #aa759f;">transform</span>ed it into an electrical signal. For the first time, we were able to transmit audio data at distances longer than an earshot.</p>
<p>Nowadays the telephone is ubiquitous. As of <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/fact-sheets/mobile-technology-fact-sheet/">January 2014</a>, 90% of American adults own a cell phone, translating to about <a href="http://www.texasinsider.org/3-billion-phone-calls-made-in-us-every-day/">3 billion</a> phone calls every day. That’s over 30000 phone calls every <em>second</em>. Imagine all those calls, all those signals — all that <em>data</em> — <a href="http://www.telcomhistory.org/vm/scienceLongDistance.shtml">flying around</a> us every second of every day. And that’s not even including all the other ways that we communicate.</p>
<p>We are literally (yes, <a href="http://theoatmeal.com/comics/literally">literally</a>) immersed in data. Drowning in it, if one prefers the macabre. Data is all around us in a dizzying array of forms, constant, inescapable. Strange, then, that we think so little about data and what it means to us. Just what <em>is</em> data?</p>
<!-- Bulleted list of data definitions from online-->

<h2 id="data-is-an-abstraction">Data is an Abstraction</h2>
<!--Money example. We use money to buy material things. Before money, we traded. Money was an abstraction for material worth, a way of storing information about how much a person "owned". Abstractions can be compounded, which is why we now have digital currency, etc.-->

<h2 id="data-is-objective">Data is Objective</h2>
<!--"Big bird" example. What qualifies as "big"? In this case the data is "big" and it is describing "bird". However if the data is "big bird" as a whole, then it is a string (or a proper name, in the case of Big Bird).-->
