<p>By itself, data isn’t terribly interesting because it just exists — that is, it’s a noun rather than a verb. In order to be useful data must be acted upon.</p>
<p>The SMART Conjecture states that there are only five things we can do to data:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ac4142;">Stream</span> it</li>
<li><span style="color: #d28445;">Maintain</span> it</li>
<li><span style="color: #90a959;">Analyze</span> it</li>
<li><span style="color: #6a9fb5;">Represent</span> it</li>
<li><span style="color: #aa759f;">Transform</span> it</li>
</ul>
<p>Together, these five actions provide all the tools we need to work with data. Let’s look at each of them in turn.</p>
<h2 id="-span-style-color-ac4142-stream-span-"><span style="color: #ac4142;">Stream</span></h2>
<p>A <span style="color: #ac4142;">stream</span> is data in motion. The concept can be illustrated in a very literal sense with a babbling brook weaving its way through a forest. Imagine stuffing little bits of information, written on pieces of paper, into tin cans and setting them afloat on the water: they’ll get carried along by the current and travel down<span style="color: #ac4142;">stream</span>. Where they’ll end up you do not know, but you can be certain that your little pieces of paper are going <em>somewhere</em>.</p>
<p>However, there’s a better example courtesy of a movie called <em>The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King</em>:</p>

        The Story Behind the Beacons
    </div>
    <div class="panel-body">
        For those of you who are not familiar with <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, I give you my elevator summary. There are two kingdoms, Gondor and Rohan, separated by a distance of <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/dotphysics/2010/07/30/how-fast-is-the-beacon-of-gond/">500 miles-ish</a>. Gondor is suddenly besieged by evil forces and needs help from Rohan. Thankfully, they’ve got this pretty sweet beacon system set up between them. I should also probably mention that this is a time before telegraphs and text messaging, so <a href="http://www.justyo.co/">yo-ing Rohan</a> for help is not an option.

<p>The beacons are an example of a binary <span style="color: #ac4142;">stream</span>.</p>
<!--
Whenever data is moving, we say it is <span style="color: #ac4142;">stream</span>ing. A <span style="color: #ac4142;">stream</span> is finite and linear. For example, when Alice and Bob are talking to each other, we say that there is a bidirectional <span style="color: #ac4142;">stream</span> of data between them. The data is whatever they're saying.-->

<h2 id="-span-style-color-d28445-maintain-span-"><span style="color: #d28445;">Maintain</span></h2>
<!--Data, by itself, decays (principle of entropy). We forget things. If something is written down, the paper yellows and the ink fades. Hard disks get corrupted. Thus we must expend energy to <span style="color: #d28445;">maintain</span> the data.-->

<h2 id="-span-style-color-90a959-analyze-span-"><span style="color: #90a959;">Analyze</span></h2>
<!--Data, by itself, does not "mean" anything. We draw meaning from data by analyzing it. For example, if a cup with a capacity of 100 mL currently contains 50 mL, we can say that it is either "half full" or "half empty". If a number is displayed as red, that usually has a bad connotation, but in some cultures red is good.-->

<h2 id="-span-style-color-6a9fb5-represent-span-"><span style="color: #6a9fb5;">Represent</span></h2>
<!--5, five, FIVE, 005, V, and 101 are all different <span style="color: #6a9fb5;">represent</span>ations of the number five. You can stretch what is a <span style="color: #6a9fb5;">represent</span>ation pretty far. Bar graphs, sculptures, different languages, art, etc. are all <span style="color: #6a9fb5;">represent</span>ations of data.-->

<h2 id="-span-style-color-aa759f-transform-span-"><span style="color: #aa759f;">Transform</span></h2>
<!--5 + 1 = 6. We have <span style="color: #aa759f;">transform</span>ed the number 5 into the number 6 by adding 1 to it. Note that this is **not** a change in <span style="color: #6a9fb5;">represent</span>ation, but a change in the underlying data itself, although the distinction between <span style="color: #6a9fb5;">represent</span>ation and data is very fuzzy (see below).-->
