<p>By itself, data isn’t terribly interesting because it just exists — that is, it’s a noun rather than a verb. In order to be useful data must be acted upon.</p>
<p>The SMART Conjecture states that there are only five things we can do to data:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="stream">Stream</span> it</li>
<li><span class="maintain">Maintain</span> it</li>
<li><span class="analyze">Analyze</span> it</li>
<li><span class="represent">Represent</span> it</li>
<li><span class="transform">Transform</span> it</li>
</ul>
<p>Together, these five actions provide all the tools we need to work with data. Let’s look at each of them in turn.</p>
<h2 id="-span-class-stream-stream-span-"><span class="stream">Stream</span></h2>
<p>A <span class="stream">stream</span> is data in motion. The concept can be illustrated in a very literal sense with a babbling brook weaving its way through a forest. Imagine stuffing little bits of information, written on pieces of paper, into tin cans and setting them afloat on the water: they’ll get carried along by the current and travel down<span class="stream">stream</span>. Where they’ll end up you do not know, but you can be certain that your little pieces of paper are going <em>somewhere</em>.</p>
<p>However, there’s a better example courtesy of a movie called <em>The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King</em>:</p>

        The Story Behind the Beacons
    </div>
    <div class="panel-body">
        For those of you who are not familiar with <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, I give you my elevator summary. There are two kingdoms, Gondor and Rohan, separated by a distance of <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/dotphysics/2010/07/30/how-fast-is-the-beacon-of-gond/">500 miles-ish</a>. Gondor is suddenly besieged by evil forces and needs help from Rohan. Thankfully, they’ve got this pretty sweet beacon system set up between them. I should also probably mention that this is a time before telegraphs and text messaging, so <a href="http://www.justyo.co/">yo-ing Rohan</a> for help is not an option.
    </div>
</div>

<p>The beacons are an example of a binary <span class="stream">stream</span>: either the beacons are lit (corresponding to a 1) or they’re not (corresponding to a 0). When the first bit is flipped to a 1 on Gondor’s end, it begins moving down the <span class="stream">stream</span> until it reaches Rohan: that’s data in motion. Simple, right?</p>
<p><span class="stream">Stream</span>s have several other important properties:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span class="stream">Stream</span>s are finite</strong>. They must have a beginning and an end. They also must have finite width, often called the <em>capacity</em> or <em>bandwidth</em>. The width of a <span class="stream">stream</span> may vary along its length; we say that its overall width is its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_flow_problem">maximum flow</a>.</li>
<li><strong><span class="stream">Stream</span>s are linear</strong>. This does not describe the physical shape of a <span class="stream">stream</span>, because in practice <span class="stream">stream</span>s are usually anything but straight lines. Rather, this suggests that a <span class="stream">stream</span> has only one beginning and one end.</li>
<li><strong><span class="stream">Stream</span>s have direction</strong> (indeed, for data to be moving it <em>must</em> have direction). We can therefore <span class="represent">represent</span> a <span class="stream">stream</span> as a vector going in either direction between its beginning and end.</li>
<li><strong><span class="stream">Stream</span>s are composable</strong>. The end of one <span class="stream">stream</span> can be linked to the beginning of another. This is an extremely powerful concept that allows for the construction of <em>networks</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Try to apply these properties to the beacon example. Do all of them hold?</p>
<p>A <span class="stream">stream</span> is the basic building block for interacting with data, and any time there is any notion of information transfer (for example, from this screen to your eyes) a <span class="stream">stream</span> is hard at work. Because they’re so important, we shall revisit them in a later chapter and examine their properties in more detail.</p>
<!--
Types of <span class="stream">stream</span> networks:

Chain
Fork
Funnel
Mux (funnel where only one input is forwarded)
Demux (fork where only one input is sent to)
-->

<h2 id="-span-class-maintain-maintain-span-"><span class="maintain">Maintain</span></h2>
<!--Data, by itself, decays (principle of entropy). We forget things. If something is written down, the paper yellows and the ink fades. Hard disks get corrupted. Thus we must expend energy to <span class="maintain">maintain</span> the data.-->

<h2 id="-span-class-analyze-analyze-span-"><span class="analyze">Analyze</span></h2>
<!--Data, by itself, does not "mean" anything. We draw meaning from data by analyzing it. For example, if a cup with a capacity of 100 mL currently contains 50 mL, we can say that it is either "half full" or "half empty". If a number is displayed as red, that usually has a bad connotation, but in some cultures red is good.-->

<h2 id="-span-class-represent-represent-span-"><span class="represent">Represent</span></h2>
<!--5, five, FIVE, 005, V, and 101 are all different <span class="represent">represent</span>ations of the number five. You can stretch what is a <span class="represent">represent</span>ation pretty far. Bar graphs, sculptures, different languages, art, etc. are all <span class="represent">represent</span>ations of data.-->

<h2 id="-span-class-transform-transform-span-"><span class="transform">Transform</span></h2>
<!--5 + 1 = 6. We have <span class="transform">transform</span>ed the number 5 into the number 6 by adding 1 to it. Note that this is **not** a change in <span class="represent">represent</span>ation, but a change in the underlying data itself, although the distinction between <span class="represent">represent</span>ation and data is very fuzzy (see below).-->
