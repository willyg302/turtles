Let's talk about turtles, you and I.

The idea that the Earth rests on a tower of turtles is [nothing new](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtles_all_the_way_down), and over the centuries the turtles have taken many forms. This book is about just one of these forms: data -- more specifically, *digital* data.

<!--Some super inspirational thing here-->

Data is our future.

## Before We Begin

This book contains its fair share of code and math. Every attempt has been made to make the content approachable to even the most novice programmer, but some basic knowledge and skills will be required.

The book is divided into three rough sections:

- **Chapters 1-3**: Philosophies and theories of data, and the main motivations for working with it
- **Chapters 4-X**: A review of current approaches to dealing with data
- **Chapters X-X**: Looking towards the future

Ready? Great! Let's go meet the turtles.
