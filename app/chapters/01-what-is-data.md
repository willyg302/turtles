# What is Data?

Like many other inventions, the origins of the telephone are murky at best. As a schoolchild I learned that Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone and, in a decidedly Archimedes moment, cried out to his assistant the now-famous line. Of course, I would later [learn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invention_of_the_telephone) that inventions are seldom the work of a few. We -- as inventors, as scientists, as researchers, as humans -- stand on the shoulders of giants.

Or maybe they're turtles.

Whatever we might like to believe about how the telephone came about, it has inarguably become a ubiqitous part of our lives. As of [January 2014](http://www.pewinternet.org/fact-sheets/mobile-technology-fact-sheet/), 90% of American adults own a cell phone, resulting in about [3 billion](http://www.texasinsider.org/3-billion-phone-calls-made-in-us-every-day/) phone calls every day. That's over 30000 phone calls every *second*. Imagine all those calls, all those digital signals, [flying around](http://www.telcomhistory.org/vm/scienceLongDistance.shtml) us every second of every day. And I'm not even bothering to include all the other ways that we communicate.

We are literally (yes, [*literally*](http://theoatmeal.com/comics/literally)) immersed in data. Drowning in it. Data is all around us in a dizzying array of forms, constant, inescapable. Strange, then, that we think so little about it.
