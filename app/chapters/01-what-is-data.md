# What is Data?

> "Mr. Watson -- Come here -- I want to see you."

One fine Boston day in the year of 1876, a man by the name of Alexander Graham Bell made what is widely believed to be the first telephone call: he shouted to his assistant, who was standing in the next room, the now-famous line.

For the moment, let us disregard the possibility that Mr. Watson simply overheard what his boss had said (after all, Bell was shouting, and just how thick did 19th-century Bostonian scientists make their walls anyway?). Let us put aside the fact that Watson [reported](http://www.wired.com/2011/03/0310bell-invents-telephone-mr-watson-come-here/) hearing something not quite the same. Let us forget all the controversy over whether Bell really did invent the telephone; inventions are seldom the work of a few, and one who patents is usually one who, having climbed on the shoulders of giants, reaches out meagerly and dares to touch the sky.

March 10, 1876, was a special day because it marked the first time that humans captured sound and transformed it into an electrical signal. For the first time, we were able to transmit audio data at distances longer than an earshot.

Nowadays the telephone is ubiquitous. As of [January 2014](http://www.pewinternet.org/fact-sheets/mobile-technology-fact-sheet/), 90% of American adults own a cell phone, translating to about [3 billion](http://www.texasinsider.org/3-billion-phone-calls-made-in-us-every-day/) phone calls every day. That's over 30000 phone calls every *second*. Imagine all those calls, all those signals -- all that *data* -- [flying around](http://www.telcomhistory.org/vm/scienceLongDistance.shtml) us every second of every day. And that's not even including all the other ways that we communicate.

We are literally (yes, [literally](http://theoatmeal.com/comics/literally)) immersed in data. Drowning in it, if one prefers the macabre. Data is all around us in a dizzying array of forms, constant, inescapable. Strange, then, that we think so little about data and what it means to us. Just what *is* data?


<!-- Bulleted list of data definitions from online-->

## Data is an Abstraction

<!--Money example. We use money to buy material things. Before money, we traded. Money was an abstraction for material worth, a way of storing information about how much a person "owned". Abstractions can be compounded, which is why we now have digital currency, etc.-->

## Data is Objective

<!--"Big bird" example. What qualifies as "big"? In this case the data is "big" and it is describing "bird". However if the data is "big bird" as a whole, then it is a string (or a proper name, in the case of Big Bird).-->

## Data is Intangible

<!--The distributed example, where a single piece of data can exist in several distant places at once, in different forms. Data is not bound by a physical system.-->
