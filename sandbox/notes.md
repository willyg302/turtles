## SMART: The 5 things we do to data

### Stream

Whenever data is moving, we say it is streaming. A stream is finite and linear. For example, when Alice and Bob are talking to each other, we say that there is a bidirectional stream of data between them. The data is whatever they're saying.

### Maintain

Data, by itself, decays (principle of entropy). We forget things. If something is written down, the paper yellows and the ink fades. Hard disks get corrupted. Thus we must expend energy to maintain the data.

### Analyze

Data, by itself, does not "mean" anything. We draw meaning from data by analyzing it. For example, if a cup with a capacity of 100 mL currently contains 50 mL, we can say that it is either "half full" or "half empty". If a number is displayed as red, that usually has a bad connotation, but in some cultures red is good.

### Represent

5, five, FIVE, 005, V, and 101 are all different representations of the number five. You can stretch what is a representation pretty far. Bar graphs, sculptures, different languages, art, etc. are all representations of data.

### Transform

5 + 1 = 6. We have transformed the number 5 into the number 6 by adding 1 to it. Note that this is **not** a change in representation, but a change in the underlying data itself, although the distinction between representation and data is very fuzzy (see below).

## Data is...

### Objective

"Big bird" example. What qualifies as "big"? In this case the data is "big" and it is describing "bird". However if the data is "big bird" as a whole, then it is a string (or a proper name, in the case of Big Bird).

## Questions

Is there a "law of conservation of data"? Thought experiment: suppose there is a man who has locked himself in a completely featureless room with a piece of paper, a pen, a lighter, and a gun. He writes down the first 8 digits that come to mind on the piece of paper. Then he burns the paper and shoots himself in the head. Questions: where did that 8-digit number "come from" and where did it "go"?

5 and FIVE are different representations of the same piece of data. But they also represent different pieces of data. "5" is an Arabic numeral. "FIVE" is a 4-letter uppercase string (an English word). Is a change in representation still a transformation? It must be, but *what* is being changed is crucial.
