## Questions

Is there a "law of conservation of data"? Thought experiment: suppose there is a man who has locked himself in a completely featureless room with a piece of paper, a pen, a lighter, and a gun. He writes down the first 8 digits that come to mind on the piece of paper. Then he burns the paper and shoots himself in the head. Questions: where did that 8-digit number "come from" and where did it "go"?

5 and FIVE are different representations of the same piece of data. But they also represent different pieces of data. "5" is an Arabic numeral. "FIVE" is a 4-letter uppercase string (an English word). Is a change in representation still a transformation? It must be, but *what* is being changed is crucial.
